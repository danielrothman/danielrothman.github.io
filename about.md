I am an Enterprise Tech Support Analyst at Dell EMC in Oklahoma City campus. I assist Enterprise customers that have difficult issues with their Dell PowerEdge servers.

On my spare time I study different fields of technology. Currently I'm working on expanding my knowlege of Cisco equipment and Networking protocols. I also enjoy work on my home lab and projects.
